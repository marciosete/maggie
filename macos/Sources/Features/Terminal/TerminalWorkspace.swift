/// macOS state restoration only brings windows back when "Close windows when quitting
/// an application" is off in System Settings (it is on by default), and it forgets
/// windows that were closed before quitting. The saved workspace fills those gaps, and
/// once there is one, macOS state restoration stands aside for it. It is opened when
/// Ghostty starts and macOS didn't restore any windows, and when the Dock
/// icon is clicked while no windows are open. Closing the last window doesn't clear it,
/// so it always holds the last windows that were open. Nothing is saved or restored with
/// `window-save-state = never`.
///
/// The saved workspace mirrors the open tabs, so on its own it would follow them into
/// any loss: twenty shells killed from outside close twenty tabs, and five seconds later
/// the workspace would hold the one left. Two things stand in the way of that. Every
/// version is also kept as a file (see `historyDirectory`), so the saved one is never the
/// only copy, and tabs closing because their processes ended are counted: several within
/// a few seconds are taken as lost, stay in the saved workspace until they are reopened
/// or let go, and the sidebar offers to reopen them (see `tabWillCloseBecauseProcessEnded`).
