# Builds a release version of Maggie and installs it as its own app, next to the
# official Ghostty:
#
#   - named "Maggie" with its own bundle ID, so it has its own preferences, saved
#     workspace and Dock/⌘Tab entry
#   - with the Maggie icon from fork/icon
#   - never auto-updates (a fork must not update from the official feed)
#   - signed with a stable local certificate, so macOS privacy answers (Photos,
#     Documents, ...) survive reinstalls. Create it once with
#     fork/create-signing-identity.sh; without it the app is signed ad hoc.
#
# It reads the same Ghostty config file as the official app.
#
# macOS keeps privacy answers (microphone, speech recognition, ...) per bundle ID and
# code signature. The official release is signed with a Developer ID certificate, so
# an install from here, under the same bundle ID, doesn't match the answers given to
# it, nor the other way round: macOS asks again, or holds the old answer against the
# new build until it is reset (Ask Again in Settings › Voice, or
# `tccutil reset SpeechRecognition <bundle id>`). To test beside the official app,
# install under another name and bundle ID: APP_NAME="Maggie Dev"
# BUNDLE_ID=com.marciosete.maggie.dev fork/install.sh.
#
# Usage: fork/install.sh [--build-only | --install-staged [--after PID]]
#
#   (no option)        build and install; Maggie must not be running
#   --build-only       build and stage the app, without touching the installed one, so
#                      it can run while Maggie is open
#   --install-staged   install the staged app and open it. With --after, wait for that
#                      process (the running Maggie) to quit first
#
# Maggie's "Update Maggie from Source…" menu item runs --build-only, then quits and leaves
# --install-staged --after <its pid> to put the new version in its place.
#
# Override with APP_NAME, BUNDLE_ID, DEST or SIGN_IDENTITY, e.g. DEST=~/Applications.
